Functional Requirements of App:
===============================
* Add todo items in the main todo list (This button should be on the nav bar) which should show a form in a new scene and entering ok should show main scene
* Mark todo as completed (in a separate screen) (which will make todo as striked out in the main todo list)
* Search todos (honors filter) (A top bar above main todo list which should change the list of main todo list based on search query. On empty, everything will be displayed)
* Filter todos (completed, active, all - honors search query). This should be available in the side menu bar

How state tree looks:
=====================
{
   todos: [[Object] {
      id: [Number],
      title: [String], // This should appear in nav bar in the todo detailed view
      description: [String],
      state: any("COMPLETED", "ACTIVE")
   }],
   visibilityFilter: any("ALL", "COMPLETED", "ACTIVE"),
   searchQuery: [String]
}
